# Neural-Network-Challenge-2

Training a neural network model using Keras to predict two outputs: department and attrition within a dataset.

## Project Summary
This project involves creating, compiling, and training a neural network model using Keras to predict two outputs: department and attrition within a dataset. 
The model is designed with two branches, one for each prediction task, and leverages shared layers to learn common features before branching into specialized layers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

###  Results Interpretation

**Department Accuracy (0.8207):** This means your model correctly predicts the department of an employee about 82.07% of the time. 
This is a relatively high accuracy, suggesting that the model is performing well in classifying the department.

**Attrition Accuracy (0.6087):** This indicates that the model accurately predicts whether an employee will leave the company (attrition) approximately 60.87% of the time. 
This accuracy is lower compared to the department prediction, which might suggest that predicting attrition is more challenging for your model.
